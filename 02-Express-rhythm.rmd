## The count {-}

Though there are many counting systems for drums, the one i prefer and teach is the _1 e & a_, where such a grouping means four sixteenth notes on beat one. Beats are easy to follow in this manner, because they always carry the number we are at, for example _2 e & a_, is the same grouping as before but on beat _2_.

From here one can find other subdivisions by just looking with attention, _#_ are notes on beat, _&_ are notes off-beat, _e_ and _a_ are sixteenth notes between beat and off-beat. It gets easier if one draws a table:

| #   | e   | +   | a   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | e   | &   | a   |
| 2   | e   | &   | a   |
| 3   | e   | &   | a   |
| 4   | e   | &   | a   |

There are many books and videos that cover the topic, so my explanation here should suffice the understanding of the diary notes.

## Mini-notation {-}

Not even close in popularity to the _1 e & a_ count, this form comes from my experience with livecoding using **[TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/)**. It is used to write patterns of notes, samples and parametters for cycling sequences. Though it's vocabulary is broader than other systems, i normally just use some of its rules when taking notes. Here is a table:

| Symbol | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| ~      | Create a rest                  |
| [ ]    | Create a pattern grouping      | 
| .      | Shorthand for pattern grouping |
| *      | Repeat a pattern               |
| !      | Replicate a pattern            |

There is way more to it, so please, visit the **[mini-notation reference](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/mini_notation)**, to learn more about this notation system,

## Express rhythm {-}

Now that these foundations are clear, let's express a rhythm mixing both counting / patterning systems:

`1 e ~!2 . 2 & . ~!4 a . 4 ~ & a`

For the first beat, i know there is a sound on beat _1_ and _e_ but then 2 sixteenth note silences. After the dot, we advance to second quarter of the rhythm, there is sound on beat _2_ and its off-beat, here i don't need to express silence, hence there are only two elements, their subdivision is on eight notes. We advance to the third quarter of the rhythm, where only the last sixteenth note has sound. Lastly i will play a drum on beat _4_, its off-beat and the last sixteenth note again.

Notice that this example is not specific on which drum/s should be played, and that's perfect because one can then orchestrate in various surfaces at will. If i wanted to be more specific, then probably the letters _k_, _s_ and _x_ would be placed instead to refer to bass drum or kick, snare drum and cymbal respectively.
